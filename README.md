# Predicting-Bitcoin-price-using-LSTM-layered-neural-network

In these two note books we use a multilayered LSTM neural network to predict the price of bitcoin using the same methodology, but different data sets. We will predict the price of Bitcoin using the fear and greed index, and the daily closing price. 

Plots in the notebook clearly show that the closing data resulted in a far more accurate model for predicting the price of bitcoin, showing that the validity of a model is equal to the validity of it's data.
